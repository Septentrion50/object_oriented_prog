# Calendar

This is an exercise concieved to master OOP (Object Oriented Programming).

## How it works

There is a main programm `app.rb` that calls two class files from the `lib` directory :

- `user.rb`
- `event.rb`

---

The main idea is that our app is a **calendar** that allows the user to book meetings or
other events with a proper starting date, duration, number of attendants and labels.
